Relationships:  we have had good luck with our 3 sons who each got college scholarships for undergrad.  They could not get any help from us to continue however and are all married to highly educated spouses and would have gone on to grad school.  We cannot fund stuff for them and their families like spouses families do.  A big thing is we can't meet up with them for weekends or vacations due the the high expense of accomodating her and 12 family members.  We have to take on all the planning and costs of the high level of vacation.  Now, we also have to hire attendants to accompany us for 24 hr care.  We just had a wedding, and the stress was just about the highest ever: new spouse chose not to accommodate, I had to hire 4 persons to drag her up a mountain (yes!) and one week of attendant to accompany her and 2 hotels rooms in 2 cities and airplane tickets.  Not one of the rest of the family even asked about the cost of all this on us.  We were stuck including her, as we could not leave her out, tho the bride and groom were willing.  Another son has not gotten married due to not wanting to attempt it.  This wedding sent us into the most serious crisis of our marriage and adult/child relationship.

Forever Changed

Every headache, 
Every cough,
Every sniffle, or sneeze 
Every scab, every bump, or little bruise, I take heed.

Each thing, each moment analyzed closely. 
Is this a new symptom, come let me look at that closely.

Should I ask for a CT, MRI, a CBC or just buy you a French fry?

We have a good prognosis! The statistics are in our favor. Can I get that written on paper? You see my heart has not gotten the message. 

Maybe the next scans will put it at ease. Maybe in a few years I will not take your temp if you sneeze. Maybe just maybe It will always be; maybe this has forever changed me.

I give extra kisses and extra hugs, I treasure little moments that before I might have shrugged. I tell you I love you with extra purpose and meaning. 

Take the good with the bad is what people always say. So I'll take a few extra snuggles today.

We have had to move several times with a family of 6.  Each time has been chaos of staying with family, renting, and finally buying and then having to remodel or add on.  Times 4!  The wheelchair access is very hard and right now we had to buy and renovate a house for her group home and currently rent to the clients in the agency at Section 8 prices at a loss.  No we would not do this unless backed into a corner!  One of the hard ones was when we sold the family home due to being a split and she needed a chair.  She slept on a bed in the living room and used the hall closet for a bath while we were showing the house to move, that was the same time we were on in home hospice.  We also had hospice 2 more times after strokes

Oh you asked about improvements?  Wow, who would think about that, just me every waking minute when we were in a chaos.  I actually looked into a hospice but the adult ones were such short term etc.  My daughter is actually trying to live a life while ""locked in"" for decades.   I never thought of it.  I would have used a half way house like Ronald McDonald several times for a couple of months while we got it together at home.  We were spit out of rehab several times without the resources at home to do it.  Very stressful on me and I could not say NO.  No power to say NO.  As a savvy consumer of Medicare now, I would figure out a way to refuse, but it has happened 4 times so far, each worse.   So counselling about release from hospital and abilitiy to refuse would help.  Awareness of abruptness of discharge without the usual nursing home options adults have and ability to plan for it???,  I just went through this with my dad and it was oh so easier, due to all the resources and choices and money available.    Adult resources are just different, they use voc rehab $, medicare, pensions, disability and personal money and adult children.  Pediatrics resources are not there, families have no money or emergency pot, no extra adults to enlist, no specialized tiered care facilities that have a life for a young adult supported. 

Improvement would mean similar resources as for adults but without the cost and barriers and tailored to pediatric and young adults who may have a long life or short one ahead.  People who understand and  can offer skill building for familes who have lost all contact with the real world.  People who support the whole family through their life span, each in their own set of life challenges and goals.  Interestingly, we did not have any professional support until our daughter was 35.  We did everything, including running a licensed care facility.  When our agency came to us, it was as if hands were there for us too.  It was a revelation, someone who considered the effects of everything on all of us and respected the demands of our life space and emotions that needed to be processed for each family member from infants, college, parent, grandparent and newly married sibs.  We continue to be amazed that someone is behind us in our caregiving job too!
