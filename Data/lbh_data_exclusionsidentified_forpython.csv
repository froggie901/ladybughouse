Forever Changed

Every headache, 
Every cough,
Every sniffle, or sneeze 
Every scab, every bump, or little bruise, I take heed.

Each thing, each moment analyzed closely. 
Is this a new symptom, come let me look at that closely.

Should I ask for a CT, MRI, a CBC or just buy you a French fry?

We have a good prognosis! The statistics are in our favor. Can I get that written on paper? You see my heart has not gotten the message. 

Maybe the next scans will put it at ease. Maybe in a few years I will not take your temp if you sneeze. Maybe just maybe It will always be; maybe this has forever changed me.

I give extra kisses and extra hugs, I treasure little moments that before I might have shrugged. I tell you I love you with extra purpose and meaning. 

Take the good with the bad is what people always say. So I'll take a few extra snuggles today.

Also at the time there was very little focus put on the psychological needs of my son.   As there was so much focus on the medical aspects of the situation and saving his life, this aspect gets left as a low priority in our experience.  I think it is very difficult to help teens and young adults in hospice and life threatening situations as they tend to withdraw to begin with, thus making any this type of support difficult to apply.  The fallout to this is that he tends to feel that his emotional needs can't and won't be addressed and he has adopted a pattern of dealing with it in his own way by self medicating.  He will of course have to meet some medical needs in the future from all the treatment he had (he's already had dual hip I replacement).  It would be great if patients could have their long term survivorship addressed appropriately.  ","How to deal with the long term arc of care which goes far past treatment, recovery and survivorship.  Also to know how to deal with how difficult it is to be a caregiver to a young adult who can make their own decisions once they are 18.  I found this very hard as my son was 14 when he was first ill.  I made all the decisions for him.  When he was 18 and older, I had to stand by as a support and advocate if he wanted me to be.  It's a difficult tightrope to walk when you don't know how long your situation can go on.  I didn't foresee handing the reins over to him because  I assumed and was told treatment would be 3 and a half years.  It went on for 10 due to relapses, etc. ","Be prepared for your situation to be totally unique when a diagnosis comes your way.  Be confident and hopeful in knowing doctors can only give you a statistical picture of what your experience and outcome will be.  Remember your child is not a statistic.   I was told that my son would have two weeks to live.  That was seven years ago.  New approaches to illness arrive on the scene all the time.  We were very lucky in this regard and our doctors broke with protocols to give our son every chance to survive even when told the likelihood of success was very low. Take every opportunity that feels right because success is often won in very unconventional ways.  Be confident and choosy about who you are working with.  If the docs are experienced in working with young adults, this is a plus as this is a special group that has special needs when faced with their mortality.  ","Referral or references for alternate caregiver service or options,Transportation help,Other","From a caregiver and patient standpoint, having some type of help with PTSD.  I see long term impact on families even after the ordeal seems over.  Having help to develop healthy skills to work through anxiety, insomnia etc would be great for the long term.  When you are so busy getting through the medical care, the emotional piece seems to get left behind and is up to the family to try and pursue.  This type of care takes so much time to find the right therapist and build a relationship.  If this type of structure were in place it would be so helpful.",Yes,,"I think what you are doing is extremely important.  Our family never had to travel far to get through our ordeal.  Although there were many long hospital stays, being able to be home often I believe added to the success of recovery and provided great healing.

Kinda made me worry when I did leave him alone with Tahlia what would be changed. 

Towards the end he kinda stopped going to her bed. He didn't want to see it, there was a high level of disengaged behavior early on. But that is not due to this one moment in our marriage. We have been married now for 15 years and it was a clear symptom that was there long before our daughter was ever sick. 

It has made us be more honest with each other now (we are in counseling) I truly believe that God had a purpose for bringing us through this dark valley.

When really that was not necessarily the case. Having hope is important,  but my hope is not lost because we lost our daughter and walking this road after hand has felt like the community at children's cancer care and the hospital as a whole has the same sociatal difficulty in accepting the fact that children die sometimes.

A few time a year is not enough.  Other than the lack of sex we have a good relationship.  I would say that when Kathryn was not doing well I ignored my husband.  Not completely but I was not the loving, doting wife.  I was living for my daughter and doing what I could for my son and my husband.  Kathryn did come first and I think everyone understood.  We have been through a great deal but we are doing fine now.",,Other,There was no hope here in Washington.  We were basically told to take her home and let her die.  She was given 3 to 6 months.  Unfortunately I think we started the alternative medicine too late.  It was working but then she ended up in the hospital and we were not able to continue the treatment.  She was in the CIU for 25 days which basically allowed her cancer to progress so fast that even starting up the treatment once we got home was not going to help.,Yes,Own,No,,,Stayed in a motel or hotel,,"It was very expensive.  We were still paying Kathryn's and Richard's housing at college.  Plus we paid our  monthly morgage for both our home and cabin.  Now we had to pay to live in a hotel for over a month and rent a car.  If there had been a place for families to stay fro even a reduced price it would have helped.  We were very fortunate to have people helping us with finances.  It really concerned Kathryn that she was costing us so much.  I told her to not worry about money.  I said, ""Money happens. I don't know how but it all works out and we will be fine.  You just worry about getting better.""",No,,"Yes, in a negative way","The last round including everything before Kathryn died and after she died I would say that period of 8 months cost us around $110,000.  I would say we have had to be very creative and are still working on taking care of finances that started back then in 2011-2012.  By next December we should finally be caught up.",No,,Terrifying - I never left her anytime she was in the hospital.  My husband was very good about taking care of the pets and house but still spending time at the hospital too.  The very first time they were not very good to parents.  She was in the ICU and they told me I could not stay in the room with her.  I told them I would not go so I had to push two hard chairs together to sleep on.  The last time they actually had a second bed in the room for us to use.  The nurses and doctors were all doing their best to be helpful and kind.  We did run into a couple that we needed to fire.,Being in our own home and town.  Friends and family and our dog and cat,"Same as above.  She missed her friends, family, home and her cat and dog.",Good staff - One doctor the last time worked really hard to get Kathryn home.  We are forever grateful to him for seeing how important it was to get her home.  He used common sense to make it happen.  We appreciated our friends and family bring us food and coming to visit.,"Allow patients and family to sleep during the night.  Some nurses were great about this and others not so good.  Do not have an open door policy.  We had to take Kathryn off of the hospital list to not have people just drop in.  She didn't want visitors all of the time and should have been able to have a way to tell people we are here and you can come up and we will meet you in the lobby.  If Kathryn felt like visiting then she could let us know and we could let people in her room or just visit with them in the lobby.  This put us in a terrible position as people checked with the hospital and they would say we were not there so they thought Kathryn had died.  This open door policy also allowed the room next to us to fill with people who were loud all night.  I said something about it and they made a change the next night.  They kicked the people out so it wouldn't be loud.  Also, anyone who touches or does any procedure on a patient should explain what they are going to do and how it will be done and make sure the patient understands.  Ask the patient if they have questions or concerns or if they have a process they like.",No one ever mentioned the side effects of steroids to us.  The emotional side effects.  The secretary at my work place told me so I was ready.  I think everything else was laid out to us pretty well.  ,"Take turns caring for the child.  One person can not do it all even if you think you are super Mom or super Dad.  Everyone should have some sort of role.  Not just to share the load but also to give everyone something to do to make them feel they are helping.  Even people outside of the immediate family want to help.  Let them!  Don't be afraid to ask someone to bring you dinner, clean your house,  take you for a walk, spend time with your other children or you or your spouse.  If someone asks what they can do state exactly what you want.  If someone wants to do a fundraiser for you, let them.  We only made it through financially because of the help we received from others.  When we were out of town my niece stayed at our house and took care of the pets.  My brother-in-law made sure the lawn was mowed and Kathryn's friends came over and took down all of the Halloween decorations so we would be ready to decorate for Christmas.  Allow people to visit.  It helps everyone to talk and share.  We did our best to have fun no matter what.  We also made sure the patient's wishes were respected.  And last but not least - you are not super human - so find a counselor to talk to.  Talking helps!  It saved my husbands life.  Kathryn's boyfriend saw a counselor from when we left for Houston and continued fro a couple of years after she died.  Don't forget there are people who love you and care about you and your family.  You are not alone.","Support for my other children,Help with social service programs,Financial assistance,Insurance assistance,Peer or professional support for self,Help with tasks of daily living (house/yard/errands/meals)",,Yes,,"The one question about moving and such didn't allow for an answer of moving out of state to get alternative care.  You might want to look into the wording on this one.  
I believe this is a great idea that will help families with the stress of dealing with a child who is dieing.  It was hard to hear my daughter ask  her doctor, ""How long do I have?""  It was even harder to have her ask me, ""Am I dieing?  I gave her the best answer I could without giving up hope.  My only regret is that we never really talked about dieing and her wishes.  She did mention a couple over the years so I did know that she wanted to be cremated and she didn't want anyone to wear black at her celebration of life.  She also wanted to know what we could give Richard her brother as we gave him skiing the first time.  We ended up using the money from selling her car to buy him the car he always wanted.  Not a brand new car but much better than the one he had.  We told him it was his gift from his sister.  I told him about our conversation and how she wanted to make sure he was ok.

Our marriage has been our rock, even with many challenges and disagreements, we have been together, what has made it better.  We don't doubt, we both sacrifice it all and we support each other in our roles.  With a seasonal Alaskan business, we were able to do parenting full time except in summer.  So we both dedicated our all all year long.  We didn't have time for skills, but when challenged, found the resource we needed due to me.  John Gottman's books (this was before his institute in Seattle) helped along with gratitude and zazen meditation.  Some counseling with specialist in chronic illness and chaos.  Mostly alot of talking and him listening to me who was unsupported by anyone else due to our rural area.  Mostly, he said, whatever you want when the kids were home, now, we both make demands.  It was very challenging.  I would say, from the first day of our marriage, without our children, we were completely committed and that saw us through.  We were only 25 when this happened and married 2 years.  Our entire life, family, friends and work have been centered on our care for our daughter, with that as the controlling factor in all.  ",,No appropriate or specialized treatment nearby,,Yes,Own,Yes,,,Bought/rented an apt/home,,"Surprisingly housing has been one of the most chaotic factors for us.  We have had to move several times with a family of 6.  Each time has been chaos of staying with family, renting, and finally buying and then having to remodel or add on.  Times 4!  The wheelchair access is very hard and right now we had to buy and renovate a house for her group home and currently rent to the clients in the agency at Section 8 prices at a loss.  No we would not do this unless backed into a corner!  One of the hard ones was when we sold the family home due to being a split and she needed a chair.  She slept on a bed in the living room and used the hall closet for a bath while we were showing the house to move, that was the same time we were on in home hospice.  We also had hospice 2 more times after strokes

Oh you asked about improvements?  Wow, who would think about that, just me every waking minute when we were in a chaos.  I actually looked into a hospice but the adult ones were such short term etc.  My daughter is actually trying to live a life while ""locked in"" for decades.   I never thought of it.  I would have used a half way house like Ronald McDonald several times for a couple of months while we got it together at home.  We were spit out of rehab several times without the resources at home to do it.  Very stressful on me and I could not say NO.  No power to say NO.  As a savvy consumer of Medicare now, I would figure out a way to refuse, but it has happened 4 times so far, each worse.   So counselling about release from hospital and abilitiy to refuse would help.  Awareness of abruptness of discharge without the usual nursing home options adults have and ability to plan for it???,  I just went through this with my dad and it was oh so easier, due to all the resources and choices and money available.    Adult resources are just different, they use voc rehab $, medicare, pensions, disability and personal money and adult children.  Pediatrics resources are not there, families have no money or emergency pot, no extra adults to enlist, no specialized tiered care facilities that have a life for a young adult supported. 

Improvement would mean similar resources as for adults but without the cost and barriers and tailored to pediatric and young adults who may have a long life or short one ahead.  People who understand and  can offer skill building for familes who have lost all contact with the real world.  People who support the whole family through their life span, each in their own set of life challenges and goals.  Interestingly, we did not have any professional support until our daughter was 35.  We did everything, including running a licensed care facility.  When our agency came to us, it was as if hands were there for us too.  It was a revelation, someone who considered the effects of everything on all of us and respected the demands of our life space and emotions that needed to be processed for each family member from infants, college, parent, grandparent and newly married sibs.  We continue to be amazed that someone is behind us in our caregiving job too!  So for the last few years of our career, we are able to start thinking about our retirement, develop some interests and make friends.  We do not take this lightly, it has been a game changer for us.  ",No,,"Yes, in a negative way","We have spent every penny we are able to make trying to accomodate the challenges of this child of ours.  We had no medical insurance, and had to move and I had to get temporary arrangements to work extra jobs 4 different times, (rural area),  We had NO retirement savings (self employed) until we were in our 50s, we had to continue in a career for 40 years way beyond time to move on and was not working for our family.  We had to move in the winter for School for the Blind and return to Alaska in the summer for our business, we did this 15 yrs, it fractured all of our relationships and even family could not empathize with our chaos.  ","Yes, in a negative way","We could not fund retirement until 55. Mother's SSI is very small as she was caregiver.  We had to move to access the waiver program due to having other kids impacted by possible bankruptsy, we had no health insurance available due to self employment, then when we had it, she was not covered.  Spent $40,000 one year then moved to a state that had the waiver.  Have bought and sold 4 houses due to changes, but no help for moving, sales etc.  Had to modify every one, constantly adapting houses and bathrooms.  

Relationships:  we have had good luck with our 3 sons who each got college scholarships for undergrad.  They could not get any help from us to continue however and are all married to highly educated spouses and would have gone on to grad school.  We cannot fund stuff for them and their families like spouses families do.  A big thing is we can't meet up with them for weekends or vacations due the the high expense of accomodating her and 12 family members.  We have to take on all the planning and costs of the high level of vacation.  Now, we also have to hire attendants to accompany us for 24 hr care.  We just had a wedding, and the stress was just about the highest ever: new spouse chose not to accommodate, I had to hire 4 persons to drag her up a mountain (yes!) and one week of attendant to accompany her and 2 hotels rooms in 2 cities and airplane tickets.  Not one of the rest of the family even asked about the cost of all this on us.  We were stuck including her, as we could not leave her out, tho the bride and groom were willing.  Another son has not gotten married due to not wanting to attempt it.  This wedding sent us into the most serious crisis of our marriage and adult/child relationship.  We had counseling and weren't speaking for months.  We are gradually healing it ourselves, due to our skills and self effacement, because as usual we have the most to lose.   My family does not contribute $ to her special needs, but will for other grandchildren's lives like college, cars.  We have just had to ""live our values everyday"" and be the bigger person alot.  ","Hell.  Because she is non verbal, we have to 100percent be there.  She has had many health crises and our advocacy has saved her life multiple times.  One time, the hospital even assigned a nurse to me for what they had caused!  Medical systems are not designed for her complicated care.  I have a concierge doctor now to help with well care, and when in the hospital, we are vigilant.  For some reason, they do not value her the same way sentient adults are.  I just went through stuff with my Dad and I was surprised how different it was.  More respect, more planning, more options, more discussion and more explaination.  When she is in, they change drs everyday, don't give her a single responsible person, change nurses every day, never let one get attached, only send in specialist if there is a malpractice concern, don't staff with rehab trained people, and even wont give her an accessible bathroom in the hospital room.  They spit her out, like a hot potato with no social workers hovering and facilities bidding for her rehab.  OT PT Speech move her out before ADL's are obtained and wont' work to keep her for goals we have,  discharge is the worst, as it is always about a week before we can do it at home.","Sleep, change of clothes and shower, control of environment, food","She just wanted to go back to what she likes to do, even if it is simply sitting in the sun, or going to the store.

More respect for the primary caregiver in discharge, better food","That the Hospital's statement of values is a way to talk to them.  Refer to this when having problems and it will get the correct attention.  Including advocacy, hospice care, end of life resources like DNR, and discharge planning.  That hospice is a different resource that has tremendous impacts when the time comes.  Pallative care is different and good.  Medicare/medicaid rules and information relating to child and to family impacts like which insurance is primary.  That HIPPA is for you, not a bludgeon for them against you and family members.","same as above.  I would say to use hospice as soon as it is available to you.  I would use the resources in the hospital more by demanding discharge planning and medication lists daily.  I still don't know how to get the medications list except by claiming an agency needs them.  There have been almost fatal medication errors almost on every admission.
